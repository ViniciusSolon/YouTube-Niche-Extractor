nossa equipe aqui sabe os molequ quando fazem editam meha minha o as lives de de cois eles fazem os vídeos verticais aí ele ajeitou as câmeras e tal PR ficar no formato né pô legal hein Legal bom galera e outra coisa que também saiu aí nos últimos dias foi o o Star Wars outla e hoje a gente tá aqui junto com quem a Claro Gaming para falar um pouco disso aqui porque Claro game está no GeForce Now certo que é o stream na nuvem que você vai poder jogar o Star Wars outlaws junto né com no je sinal com o Claro Gaming tá certo é o seguinte eh a Claro colocou tanto tá na Claro TV com Disney Plus né você consegue assistir lá a cronologia completa do Star Wars para você entender todo o contexto do jogo e entender esse universo Star Wars que o Fenix obviamente conhece muito mas é gigantesco tem muita coisa e você pode experienciar tudo lá na Claro TV também junto com Claro game então você pode usar o QR Code que tá na tela o link na descrição Essa é a semana do gamer né Gamer Week é claro está fazendo todo toda essa campanha também você pode assinar ver vê os links aqui embaixo e aproveite para entender a cronologia do Star Wars junto com o Star Wars outlock tá no meio de tudo isso aí né porque é entre o primeiro filme e o quat c não é isso é bota aí na tela o Tak já Claro até fez uma linha do tempo pra gente entender melhor ó e basicamente tem o Star Wars 1 2 3 né a prickles que o George Lucas fez aí tem o qu c e se e o Watch loss tá entre o cinco e o seis ali ó ele entra depois do Impéria contra-ataca e antes do retorno do Jedi que é bem momento que né o império tá dominando a galáxia inteira o rans solo tá em Carbonita lá no Jaba o Luke meio que sumiu né Depois do episódio 5 ele foi virar mais mestre né ele treinou nesse período bastante então é um período bem interessante explorar na história que o império Tá forte ainda né e a ke ves é é só uma pessoa normal né no meio disso tudo não entre o Episódio 56 então isso ent Episódio 5 e se leg e é legal porque no jogo você consegue ver indícios desse momento da história Depende de onde você passa você vê personagens ou cenas é Inclusive só dentro antes do filme quatro tem o hog One que conecta diretamente com quatro e tem referência do H One nesse jogo no out Lost tem uma missão ou outra que eles comentam sobre algumas coisas do do hog One bem interessante legal muito legal bom Ó o Rick el Ganso deu cinco membros pro chat Pedro R mandou R 10 o adut jun mandou já falou porque não tem jogo tipo do Game of Thrones ah muitos motivos cara eu membro pelo é mas a a né jog menor mas teve T de estratégia também que teve estratégia teve um de Aventura horrível também esse eu joguei também morrendo foi muito e Fábio sobrin mandou R 5 adto Júnior mandou R 2 falou do negócio do tiktok o Caio e Caio Armando mandou R 10 o alu cardes mandou 2790 falou boa noite pessoal da mesa e é o r vão da Epic Vale a pena comprar o swit esse não conheço esse o Switch OLED Quais jogos me indicariam pô switched vale muito a pena jogos que eu indico cara todos os jogos de Nintendo né para começar tip uh Mario todos os jogos grandes da nintend a gente recomenda aqui mas um que eu recomendo que dificilmente eu vejo alguém recomendando é o Golf Story Golf Story muito bom esse lanou junto com o Switch logo depois do lançamento do Switch ele é muito bom exclusivo de swit é um RPG de GO falar swit eu vi uma informação hoje que eu fiquei um pouco Assustado assim né só o Eric Williams mandou R falou que quem nunca viu os filmes joga de boa outl de boa cara sim J cara que você vai curtir mais se você gosta do universo Star Wars é um tem bastante né fun service assim para galera é bem o universo Star Wars né Eh mas então houve uma informação hoje que o Scarlet viet Pokémon sim que foi um desastre até hoje não tá lá essas coisas né tipo em questão Taí voltou a jogar agora e ficar mostrando ali pelo amor Deus eh sai a notícia era Scarlet vals não vendeu tanto quanto o Sword em shield que foi o anterior que não foi lá essas coisas aham não vendeu tanto 53 milhões é é [ __ ] bizarro irmão então por bizarro Quanto é uma comparação se ela é uma comparação di que assust tipo assim vendeu mes mesmo assim vendeu mais 50 mil chegou pertinho né ele chegou pertinho do do do do número do Sword shield e que é um número impressionante porque o Sword shield também não é um jogo bom de Pokémon Vamos ser sincero é não é não é não é o o suprassumo do Pokémon que a gente estava acostumado a gerações atrás eu acho que dessa geração Só gostei mesmo do Arceus que nem é da entrada principal então é não é goi M PR mim ainda é o primeiro e olha que a gente a gente podia ter estranhado muito esse sistema de que você só arremessa a bola para pegar o Pokémon porque tinha toda aquela a questão da Batalha não sei o qu vocês jogaram com a pokol v dropei dropou dropei não eu usei por um tempo só que eu vi um vídeo de uma pessoa jogando e em vez de usar o controle tava usando essa pokebola E aí ela encontrou um draus Shiny com a pokol e por causa dessa pokebola Ela errou tá ligado porque é uma merda Z o controle é mais fácil você usar falei tá maluco eu não vou eu não vou arriscar negócio desse não eu vou arriscar negócio desse não um shiney não perderia e o melhor Pokémon para pegar Shiny é o let's go é mais fácil fáil porque pela por um sistema de repetição que você fica sempre na mesma D você CONSEG cada vez você tem mais chances né de encontrar sim ah é muito bom mas o Legends também é legal e se você quiser aquecer pro próximo LED né Pois é eu gostei muito do diamond eu sei que o povo é Hater mas eu amei o Diamond pro Amei Hardcore o povo Odeia Eu amo ah tem um kit para eu abrir da Claro aqui que o qu Opa ol que beleza mandou pra gente vocês vão gostar só o Fênix ganha de negócio né kit AB que

Gaming pelo presente e fica aí a pra galera se quiserem jogar o out loss no GeForce Now tá aí a dica e também assistir os filmes filmes no Disney Plus também com Claro tá bom muito bom é isso rapaziada obrigado a todo mundo que já está aqui na Live com a gente e o AD Jor mandou R ele perguntou eu vou passar rápido por isso porque a gente não tem nenhuma confirmação disso tá Mas é interessante a gente comentar o que vocês acham da exclusividade do Black me Play 5 eu acho que você tá querendo dizer de um rumor que saiu que Possivelmente teria um acordo secreto entre a Sony e o a Game Science lá para o Hong seja Exclusive de Playstation 5 por isso não teria sa na Xbox eu não sei se a gente se eu acredito muito nisso porque por que Não por que que ISO não seria exposto entendeu se se fosse verdade entende Total tá um em bróglio isso aí sabe porque assim porque obviamente a galera do Xbox tá sendo cobrada por isso e tá se tornando mil especulações porque que não tá no Xbox é só os caras falar irmão os caras tem a coisa lá pô tem duas teorias né você não sei se você viu a de hoje tem duas teorias hoje a primeira é que eles estão produzindo pro Xbox mas tem problemas técnicos isso E aí assim o rumor mais profundo é que talvez o series S seja problema que já V aquela coisa de indústria que tem um memory leak que resumidamente é tipo um erro de memória que tá faltando memória para rodar o jogo O segundo é que a Sony tem um contrato secreto aí de que né não tá público mas um outro insider que é o Ah esqueci o nome dele que é do o exis é o extasis não é que é o cara que falou do Forza que ia sair pra Play outro cara depois eu procuro aqui mas ele disse que na verdade a Sony ajudou o desenvolvimento mas não tem acordo exclusivo tipo Pub quando lanou no Xbox a ajudou a fazer o o de Xbox é normal isso acontece mas a gente não sabe n o que eu vi é o extasis que é outro insider que falou que não tem nada a ver isso aí que que não tem acordo exclusivo nada e é uma invenção da galera e por Sera secreto entende exato porque normalmente a cor de exclusividade quando o jogo passa por um período de exclusividade vira até um um marketing em cima disso pagando gost do que a Playstation né Rogers Legacy lembra que nem era exclusivo Mas tinha uma missão exclusiva e Nossa o bafafá que eles fizeram eles fazem o marketing em cima da exclusividade que eles compraram E por que que eles não fariam pro Black meth né não faz sentido eu acho que mais um caso de que eles ganharam a sorte que nem o BS Gate que a XBox só por algum motivo não fez e aí a Sony ganhou acho que tem uma camada mais acho que a Sony ajuda essa galera acho que ela deve buscar parceiros ali de jogos potenciais e ajuda mas a desenvolver console Xbox não poderia fazer isso também mas talvez tenha feito que por exemplo o Gam Impact porque o g Impact Não eu não lembro de ter acordo de exclusividade mas só sai no Playstation e PC ele foi anunciado pra Switch lembra e nunca saiu então tem lá uma uma umas coisas e tal e a gente sabe que Xbox não tem muita profundidade do mercado asiático né Tem muita dificuldade lá mas acho que é mais uma uma bola fora da do Xbox lembra do do bald GATE 3 vocês não apostaram a gente comentou essa notícia que eles eles chutaram tipo um joguinho de quro 3 milhões Pro Game Pass E aí virou um sucesso eu acho que eles estão meio à vezes eles acertam também né o Paul WS foi um grande acerto que eles trouxeram Day one Game Pass Esse foi um grande Acer ver é verdade tem lembrar exatamente ó o Yen acabou de virar membro Muito obrigado o John Pierre mandou R Pokémon XY ainda o Melhor Para Mim zerei todos eles o noob Master e mandou R 10 falou fal Pokémon recentemente Comecei a jogar Pokémon go depois de anos alguém ainda joga ó o Cardoso Cadê o Cardoso Cardoso voltou a jogar Pokémon GO cal calma aí eu baixei de novo mas porque teve o World Championship lá no Havaí e eles estavam dando um Pikachu da como é que fala snorkel não como é que é aquele negóci m né É o snorkel mesmo nome do cara não é só num Master é num Master six9 é a gente né de família né o é não é o nome do cara que humilha o Thor no Avengers eu acho que é fica puto ele fala não NOB eu vou te matar agora tem a crítica aqui ó o FX ó C 139 vi comer isso desde quando assistiu e o hero Nice beijo para vocês abração da produção ai amo amo amo Ai que legal passo eu confesso que às vezes vira mée quando eu faço essas receitas japonesas assim porque lá em casa o que eu menos faço é sushi porque o David não come então de prato quente eu vivo fazendo E aí eu posso postar as receitas de vez em quando é que eu não sabia que o pessoal se interessava assim não eu quase passei mal hoje por nossa Acabou com meu C comig eu entendi que você ia chegar numa coisa positiva mas a sua pausa eu comi muito rápido inclusive porque tava bom demais Mania eu AC Nossa Senhora eu passei mal ó update Twitter ainda não caiu então não tem update nenhum Ô F update é se tivesse Cao que nãoa caiu pô mas c o David Gamer virou membro Muito obrigado e o Eric Williams falou um negócio que a gente comentou aqui e faz sentido falou Son sendo cobrado pela falta de anúncio e esconder isso é faz o melhor sentido isso seria um B marketing para eles porque o o Kong tá muito hypado para eles não falarem nada sobre isso então dobrou dobrou o número de vendas de PS5 na China que é um mercado Maior difícil de console não faria sentido é e falou Xbox deixar crítica massac Cross ser é se não fosse esse problema então ô Eric eu vou te falar que tanto a Sony quanto a Microsoft não tão muito bem na na comunicação não tá ligado nem um pouco demorando para falar ou não falando nada ou deixando entender certas coisas e aí continua isso aí pô né claro que pode ser real esses problemas a gente só vai saber depois e a gente vai ver eu eu eu acho que depois de ser as coisas que aconteceu essa geração a próxima não vai ser a estratégia vai ser outra em relação a negócio de Xbox series x se que vai ter dois duas versões e tal aí fal também e o Concord hein hum Concord ô ô Takes dá uma olhada aí No Steam charts aí eu ia perguntar como é que tá V steb vê quantas pessoas estão no Concord nesse momento vend tinha acho que 97 97 é é no PC né no PC sim não a gente falou a gente tinha chutado o número 600 pessoas quando que foi Acho que começou com no lançamento ele teve 69 então não mas aí depois tava comparando com o deadlock E aí você eu acho que foi durante a nossa Live de Star Wars você chutou assim ah daqui um tempo vai est tanto é eu falei que daqui um mês vai est 10 pessoas jogando não galera Pera aí isso aí tá tá não tá funcionando né não não não é possível não tá errado eu tava eu tô vendo aqui agora no não sei porque tá assim mas eu tô venho aqui no app eu tenho o app do Steam DB instalado no meu celular Claro que tem e no app do Steam DB ele tá falando aqui ó 11 11 players é tava zero aqui zer tava zero Ah tá não é 111 111 players agora 100 pessoas no Concorde no mundo é detalhe no mundoira aí galera bota aí Dead Lock só para ver Caraca Que que foi só para ver o deadlock ess daí queria chtar cachorro morto fix não botar então o CS aí pô não mas é o CS todo mundo pode jogar o deadlock é só convite bota 10 univers Dead Não é esse aí rapaz cara é realmente é muito triste a situação desse jogo porque o erro é o preço né cara um tem muito erro mas o hero Shooter hoje em dia pago existe isso não existe não existe só vi uns Gameplay Não Me interessou zero e eu acho que mas se fosse graça eu ia testar entendeu eu joguei o Beta deles lá eu achei Ok não achei de todo ruim meio genérico É meio genérico mas pô tem muito jogo de graça né grilla mano Isso aí é o deadlock 11 cara cresceu uns 20.000 de ontem para hoje o recorde foi hoje 100 e pouquinho não é bateu foi ont então ontem bateu 100.000 agora já bateu 127.000 aí ó impressionante Então galera e é assim isso é relevante o que acontece é um jogo da Sony um exclusivo Playstation quer dizer Playstation PC no e esse jogo saiu né que ele tá em desenvolvimento há 8 anos meu Deus fque com dó dos desenvolvedores 8 anos tá 8 anos então a gente pode cravar aí que 100 200 milhões de dólares pelo menos que foi o gasto desse jogo tá não foi revelado ainda o custo do do Concord tá E é um jogo que desde que foi que assim esse jogo não foi mostrado a gente ficou sabendo dele não faz tanto tempo não foi no foi em maio não foi não então ano passado a gente tinha anunciado tinha um logo né E a gente não sabia o que era o jogo aí os caras fazem tipo assim eles mostram que é o jogo em maio a gente não sabe nada sobre ele você não constrói Cara a Sony é para est muito confiante de si mesmo achando que só porque vai lançar um jogo de PlayStation que vai bombar sem ninguém saber nada e aí entra nesse negócio aí do J Ryan aí né desde que ele entrou esse negócio dos Live service não sei o qu E aí assim por um lado né e a a gente obviamente É uma pena pro estúdio todo mundo lá vai se [ __ ] porque ISO sabe lá o que vai acontecer porque floo os caras estão fazendo um jogo a 8 anos que é para um jogo para durar 10 20 anos pô porque na cabeça desse executivo é isso eu vou fazer um jogo aqui infinito que vai bombar o o que que vendeu esse jogo O que deve estar gerando dinheiro não sustenta operação é simples assim sabe uhum eh por um lado é horrível para eles lá agora é uma mensagem né o o o público tá dando uma mensagem muito clara paraa Sony sobre esse tipo de de situação o jogo que é um hero Shooter pago que quando foi mostrado não teve a toda a mídia todas as pessoas que viram que jogaram os betas falaram Cara isso aí ó é né vai os caras estam mesmo assim eu espero que a Sony tem uma leitura de mercado melhor do que a Warner por exemplo que a Warner fracassou com o o Esquadrão Suicida e teve um baita sucesso com Hogwarts Legacy e o mortal kombat 1 e a e o que conclusão a conclusão da foi temos que fazer mais jogo tipo esquadr suicida Pô aí é difícil né É complicado não e eu vi aqui que esse estúdio e o firewalk Studios que fez esse Concord é um estúdio novo ele foi fundado em 2018 e ele foi comprado pela Sony adquirido pela Sony em 2023 só ano passado e quando a Sony adquiriu Ele eles anunciaram o Concord que seria o primeiro jogo desse Estúdio esse estúdio formado por veteranos da Band e da activision pessoas que trabalharam No Destiny Principalmente quando a bandy era da activision né naquele período e a galera que saiu de lá abriu esse estúdio e fez esse primeiro jogo deles e a gente viu no Gameplay que ele parece muito Destiny mesmo né então daí que vem só que cara eu eu eu queria entender de onde veio esse pricing essa decisão do do modelo de negócio desse jogo porque não faz sentido nenhum ainda mais hoje em dia parece que ele se perdeu no tempo porque esse jogo devia ter Sao antes do overwatch exatamente isso que i fal o8 anos 8 anos atrás 2016 overwatch ganhou o Game of the Year é foi quando foi lançada então parece muito aquela coisa de vou me embarcar Nessa onda de Hero Shooter só que foi uma coisa que foi mal otimizada e perdeu o timing E aí você pensa assim cara então não é mais o momento de Hero Shooter não porque aí a gente tem o exemplo da Marvel É sim que funciona super bem e tá no Hype tá no Hype o o Marvel Rivals É Só triste por conta do rival é de graça então então assim parece que foi uma sucessão de decisões erradas de um negócio que ficou datado que passou do tempo de tá ali já é e assim essa essa questão de cara vamos tentar lembrar aí se alguém consegue lembrar isso que jogo only multiplayer hoje é pago gente tem algum aí é difícil only multiplayer né não tem campanha é até o overw 2 que prometeu campanha que não teve é de graça né o pubg ficou ficou de graça depois de 1000 anos T Pub não e pubg é uma loucura né que o jogo precisava de 100 pessoas para ter um Lobby e era pago É doideira como era mas aí ficou de graça mas ele tinha 3 milh 300000 players Então galera beleza o Hell divers 2 foi mas foi o Hell ders 2 foi talvez a Son temha achado que era isso que el acertar de novo né po Battlefield galera mas o Battlefield tem campanha não tem Battlefield tem eu acho pera aí cs2 é pago cs2 não é de não tá louco Então os jogos da valve há muito tempo eles viraram de graça não era né o CS era pago o team fors era pago aí desde que veio Dota de graça já eles transformaram o TF2 em de graça e o csgo também virou de graça né então assim esse modelo Free to Play ganhando com com microtransação no jogo já virou um modelo padrão de jogo multiplayer né se você vai fugir disso é é porque o seu jogo é muito específico tipo o Hell divers mas o eu acho que é R 100 o o valor dele esse Concord é R 200 sers é pve também né é uma out P diferente é o a galera tá falando do o bf acho que é o 22 mul galera falando aqui do Rainbow Six ainda é pago gente não o r divers é R 200 eu falei errado de graça agora não Oi pago Ah é tipo sei lá uns 27 não é uma coisa assim a última vez que eu vi mas o caso do Rainbow Six é bom porque muito Possivelmente em breve ele vai ser de graça cara tem muitos rumores aí no no no meio do Rainbow Six que a ub vai fazer um grande update no jogo e vai mudar a Eng inclusive porque a antigo jogo já é antigo 2016 né 15 é já tá na hora e aí é e naquela época 2016 o overwatch também foi pagoa outra época mas aí com esse update se tornaria Free to Play também então eu não acho que salvaria mas acho que esse jogo tinha que estar na Plus tinha que ser uma inauguração um Day one plus pelo menos se ele for de graça se tiver coisa dessa ele tem alguma chance de alguma coisa né porque a gente tem uma outra informação hoje aqui que o ex defi da Ubisoft que alcançou até 20 milhões de jogadores está com problemas e é de graça Você tá entendendo você ter jogadores cara a gente fala aqui e e assim não é uma parada Live service é muito difícil você manter cara é muito difícil exige muito dinheiro tipo ex defiant tá aqui ó segundo jornalista Tom Henderson da insider Game aof São Francisco tá uma corrida contra o tempo a f alcance mais jogadores até o final da temporada três ou corre o risco de perder o suporte ou seja acabar cancelar o jogo tá ligado é o sucesso obtido nas primeiras semanas quando foram registrados mais de 8 milhões de jogadores no no jogo parece que foi se Perdendo aos poucos são substituídos por uma queda brusca de número de jogadores ativos de acordo com as fontes ouvidas pelo site o jogo está dando duro para obter 20.000 jogadores simultâneos em todas as plataformas 20.000 muito ruim não é ruim não 20.000 para gente tá ruim e o Concorde com 100 bicho é realmente né 100 pessoas não é 100.000 é 100 pessoas cara sabe e tá aqui caso o cenário não melhor Fontes acreditam que demissões serão apenas questão de tempo Nossa que TR ah Lemi do muito pago até você gosta o Hunt Showdown né hun Showdown é pago hun Showdown é pago é pago e tem mais Player Basic o mas Showdown é um caso de um jogo de extração e esse gênero todos são pagos né inclusive o tarkov que é o maior desses e assim é pago muito absurdo tem tem um pacote de 500 lá e a galera paga então é enquanto a galera pagar eles vão deixar mas eu acho que no caso do Run Showdown ele é um pouco pve também né ele tem pve e ele tem PVP é eu acho que o o meu ponto é Hero Shooter não existe pago hoje em dia não existe só se você fizer um negócio muito [ __ ] e que tem a história também aí eu acho que justifica inclusive Outro ponto né o o Concord foi divulgado com aquele trailer cinematográfico seji ele não tem pve né não tem nada de história mas é a mesma coisa que o overwatch né eles vão construindo uma Lore por trás que é um jogo só multiplayer Pelo amor de Deus né cara é assim eles tentaram copiar a Blizzard mas a Blizzard é muito boa nisso né eles constróem muito bem is aí e aí por que que o x the f não sobreviveu a gente pode botar vários motivos Mas você lembrava de X Def Fight até eu falar aqui agora se se você não tá jogando Você não tá jogando x Def F você você tem como tipo esquecer fortnite você não consegue esquecer fortnite ele tá em todo lugar você entende é é isso A diferença é code consegue esquecer o cod não dá para esque se você tá no meio de videogame você não consegue não saber o que tá acontecendo com cod por precisa um esforço de marketing gigante e de divulgação e de tá ativo o tempo todo para manter jogo vivo não é mole né óbvio que tem algumas exceções lá o pubg os caras faz marke horrível mas é é diferente são jogos muito especiais o exf é um jogo especial como cod pubg fortnite não é poderia ter um sucesso se a Ubisoft tratasse o bagulho com mais Mas aí tem que gastar grana pô os cara os caras acham que fazer Live service vai ser o dinheirinho ali ó tá ligado vou gastar um negocinho aqui vou vou ficar dinheiro infinito vou viver de renda viver de renda parece que é isso não é isso cara gasta muito muito muito dinheiro para manter o Live service vivo pô sabe vê o que fortnite faz galera é muito não é só dinheiro é um trabalho ferrado você tem que ter os desenvolvedores certos você tem que ter uma equipe de marketing muito melhor do que todas as outras suas porque para você fazer marketing no jogo single player é uma coisa para fazer marketing do Live service eterno é outra são outras pessoas que têm que ter seus concorrentes né do gênero exato Você ainda tem os concorrentes tal essa onda de Live service é louco porque diferente das ondas de ah sei lá vamos fazer jogo estilo futurista um exemplo tá você fala lá o seu jogo estilo futurista falar Live Surface não é só você fazer o jogo você tá entendendo é muito além de só fazer um jogo e parece todas as empresas do orne a própria Sony a visão delas era muito Rasa sobre isso não tinha um plano Bom o negócio doov quando foi cancelado era algo que a gente via tipo o os caras da nor Dog meio que falaram para ele galera olha a gente pode fazer isso aqui os parecia que os executivos da Son acharam que eles iam fazer o jogo ia largar lá e Valeu aí o cara fal não cara ó a equipe inteira tem que ficar em cima desse jogo para sempre senão não não vai rolar Então mas aí eu acho que volta a repetir o que a gente falou nessa situação aí da questão do The Last of Us que é parece que as decisões que vem de cima de um monte de gente engravatado que não faz ideia do que tá acontecendo ali na indústria então no exemplo do fortnite fortnite já tá aí há anos Mas toda hora eles está se reinventando tá fazendo parceria com show tá tá trazendo essa última leva aí que teve agora teve coisa da Marvel então a galera com as skins então tem toda uma uma questão não só de de roupagem né de de aproveitar essas parcerias com com a estética mas também muda gamep em determinados momentos então é uma é um retrabalho constante disso daí não é realmente é o que o vin falou assim Acho que os engravatados fala não faz aí vive da renda é pois é é o engravatado que sabe ler número sim é o número emesa ali falou é isso aqui Aham Aí tem explicar não não isso aqui é o futuro é o que o mercado tá ditando é isso aqui que vocês vão fazer só que não é assim né Eu não acho que assim é o que o mercado tá ditando eu acho que a gente até brincou falando do satiana dela né falando assim pô por que que a gente não faz isso Uhum Então mas isso vai requerer que isso não não não mas isso aqui vai trazer mais dinheiro faz aí é isso pois é é é e assim e eu tenho um conselho para vocês todos é legal isso é um vídeo de um youtuber gringo o cara chama the act Man é bom o canal dele mas ele entrevistou o mari que é um cara que trabalhou na Band por muitos anos desde o início da Band no Halo 1 2 3 A DST e ele trabalhou no dest também é o cara que faz as músicas ele que que fez a música do Halo que é clássica né e o que acontece esse cara ele esteve na Band desde o início a Band depois que virou da Microsoft teve muito problemas eles tentaram sair na Microsoft e ele conta toda essa história no no canal desse cara é muito interessante para você ver o que que acontece nessa indústria O que que a gente fala dos engravatados e tal ele fala Exatamente isso cara uma hora chega um executivo uma hora a Microsoft vira e fala a gente quer esse cara faz parte da equipe de vocês porque ele falou quando a Band entor na Microsoft eles falam não a gente quer ser independente tudo bem a gente é da parte da Microsoft mas a gente fica no canto de lá a gente faz o nosso reporter do nosso J A gente é ainda bante independente e a Microsoft topou isso só que aos poucos a Microsoft vai incluindo Ah esse cara aqui agora da equipe de vocês é um cara infiltrado entendeu esse cara tá PR ajudar chama ele aí é para ajudar e tal e aí ele ele foi contando a história resultado no final ele saiu da empresa e e a Band processou ele e tirou a as ações que ele tinha da empresa porque ele entrou no começo ele tinha direito a várias ações e os caras tiraram dele e ele entrou no processo contra os caras na corte e ganhou e ele ganhou as ações e deu bom porque a Sony comprou a Band aí ele vendeu as ações pra Sony e ele se deu bem e ele conta toda a história cara é muito interessante ver por dentro desse mercado uma empresa com uma band que era uma um estúdio ind Começou assim ah vamos fazer negócio nosso negócio aí Microsoft um colosso chegou e falou não agora vocês vão faler esse jogo aí pra gente só para Xbox ele até fala que quando lançou o Halo 1 eles brigaram para lançar pro PC e a Microsoft falou não não vai lançar pro PC é só Xbox E aí eles ficaram muito triste porque na época FPS era PC né E eles tomaram esse caminho de não vender Possivelmente 1 milhão de cópias no PC 2 milhões e ele conta toda essa história é muito legal é um é um passo de uma hora com o cara aconselho muito verem Manda o link para nós depois aí manda no grupo depois mandar inclusive num assunto similar a Game informer que agora né infelizmente foi de base ela fez uma matéria recentemente não sei se foi em junho com um Jornalista conversando com ceos de empresas coreanas whis que fez Liv of pe teve stellar Blade tá tendo um Boom de jogos Triple a coreanos né E tentou entender porque que vocês saíram do mercado mobile que é muito forte no Oriente esse estilo gaa e passe de batalha e começaram a fazer Triple a e eles estavam conversando de que não vale mais a pena você tem que investir muito dinheiro o cara tem que jogar o mês inteiro para te dar 10 se muito e que nas contas deles não não tá fazendo mais sentido fazer porque Car tá saturado tá saturado você Tem que prender o cara por muito tempo para tirar um uma grana pequena você tem que ter muito sucesso num jogo para valer a pena é pois é e aí interessante essa matéria é E aí assim eles foram para esses jogos e todos eles fizeram sucesso né esses grandes que vieram o li of peill David The diver Stell Blade né Eh e agora o kg na China e tal então É um negócio de Olha o o Daniel Cotrin não sei se é real Mas ele respondeu aqui eu no Twitter falando que ele resgatou a primeira chave que a gente soltou do Black ele que resgatou aqui muito bom cara vamos soltar segunda chave então soltamos já tá aí ó soltamos o qu a segunda chave doong na nuvem segura amor é então o jor não acho que jog Live service teria que ter um tempo de suporte mínimo para não virar ess canamento em deveria mas não tem né assim toda vez que fal não 10 anos garantido se meses vários assim tem números assim números que aconteceu isso sinceramente OB out é se você lança um Live service tem uma base de play de 100 pessoas depois de o quê uma semana de lançamento Você vai continuar o suporte às vezes não faz sentido né então eu acho que não não é bom pra empresa ter o mío Como que você justifica isso pô ligado como gala foi um flop desculpa que ficou financiando você é quem comprou também E aí porque tem isso também né um problema é porque vai começar em algum momento os advogados americano se você vai em Los Angeles ou qualquer mas los ang tem muito é Outdoor para tudo quanto é lado de advogados tá falou assim ó eu vou te ajudar pção é tem a hora que esses caras começarem a ver o que que as empresas de videogame faz e a quantidade de de de e direito do consumidor que eles quebram um atrás do outro vai ter uma onda que vai ser processo um atrás do outro verade caus desse negóci aí chegar esse h a esse jogo o Concordia aí só pra galera do Xbox ficar brava comigo como sempre eu gosto eu vou trazer um exemplo de um jogo que me lembrou muito o o caso do Concord puxa aí o Tak No Steam DB o jogo que chama bleeding Edge lembra do bleeding EDGE é um jogo da Ninja of fy que fez o Hell Blade né grande empresa e eles fizeram um Live service que também é um multiplayer de combate ele não é Hero Shooter mas meio que é você escolhem um um herói tem umas Skills e tem Unos objetivos ele é parecido mostra o gráfico dele de de de o o o o gráfico dele de players all time aí bota Max e mostra na tela porque ele tem um comportamento muito similar ao Concord el lançou tem uma base de players que é muito maior tem servidor então ó tem um cara jogando agora um cara um cara eita quem que é esse cara é o cara que fez o jogo né coitado mas aí ó ele teve um pico quando lançou ali ó 14 64 já é o dobro que o Concord teve tá é o dobro Mas ó logo depois ele caiu ó bota ali o takete no no fim dessa curva para baixo ó Maio quanto que ele lançou bota ali embaixo aí em cima Março eh dois meses depois ele já dropou dos 1200 para 100 Então eu acho que vai agora sim Concord já tá agora com é uma semana depois né então assim o Concord deve tomar esse caminho aí ó porque todo o resto do período até hoje é 10 players sete players ex então assim eu não sei nem como essas esses players estão jogando né porque é um jogo multiplayer como que forma a partida vai ver o filho do cara baixou sem querer lá e ligou e assim e aí o que acontece também nesse negócio de Live Surface né o que acontece obviamente muitos estúdios por aí vem que tem dinheiro nesse ne Live tem dinheiro não é que o jogo Dee vai fazer sucesso é que tem gente querendo investir nisso então você vai lá e Farma irmão então tem um monte de estúdio que vai nessa Ah o cara quer fazer Live Ah eu faço para você isso aqui pô tá ligado e o cara o cara entrega o cara entrega o que você pediu E aí vai dar nisso aí vai lá disputar com cod FIFA fortnite boa sorte pô disputar com essa galera eu eu o que eu acho que talvez os executivos não entendam é é justamente que você está disputando o tempo das pessoas e o tempo das pessoas jogando é muito diferente tempos as pessoas vendo uma série um filme é bem diferente bem diferente é muito mais tempo tá ligado muito tempo jogo deses é é é rotina é uma coisa regrada já é e é muito tempo e não dá para ter muitos na sua rotina não exato Então você tem que chamar mais atenção que um cod vai chamar daquela pessoa na semana é boa sorte aí é difícil é difícil brigar com cod é esse é o jogo de tiro a brigar com c sendo e sendo online dessa maneira não é só uma pessoa tem que um grupo de pessoas estar dispostos a ceder um tempo também para essa pessoa quer jogar que aceitou ceder o tempo dela é loucura isso aí cara muito é muito difícil é difícil fazer um Live Surface hoje em dia né Muito difícil Pô muito difícil você tem que fazer com TR Opa vai Fênix mais uma vez fez um vídeo falando queou dat mining tá E tá aqui ó aparentemente novo vídeo de game follower não trouxe grande novidades quent mas reuni alguns rumores que estav espalhados por aí reunidos através de data mining segundo o o gab follower que tá aqui tem um aqui n é então Half Life 3 deve ter um mundo semiaberto ciclos de dia e noite e até mesmo sistema de clima dinâmico tá já o Tyler mcvicker responsável vazar Originalmente a existência do jogo também soltou um novo vídeo conteúdo ele dá alguns detalhes da produção do jogo diz que provavelmente não teremos novidades reveladas em breve ou nunca né é que vai ter vai ser 20 anos do Half Life 2 né em vai Novembro é agora agora em novembro vai ser 20 anos o Half Life 2 mas é o Half Life 2 o o o original né teve o episódio um e o episódio dois depois mas assim é interessante porque eu acho que eles vão fazer poucas coisas a valve a valve fez um update no no no H Life que ninguém sabe o que é Eles criaram uma pasta secreta lá que não é acessível E aí a galera tá supondo que eles vão fazer alguma coisa de aniversário mas todo mundo tá achando que é o Half Life 2 rtx que vai ser a comemoração de 20 anos que é um remake feito pela comunidade como todos os remakes da valve a valve não faz remake né a comunidade que faz para eles e aí o uns caras estão fazendo um remake muito legal do Half Life 2 RTG que eu mostrei aqui na semana passada e e eu acho que vai ser esse a grande comemoração de 20 anos então não não deve ter update do do Half Life 3 mas co legal né que é mundo aberto com o sistema do Dia e Noite de clima eu acho bem legal isso porque a questão é qual que vai ser o grande diferencial do Half Life 3 se vai ser Half Life 3 né porque os outros sempre tiveram alguma coisa grande vindo com eles qual que esse vai Tera sempre at lado a source enging também super S Eng tem que vir a sor Eng mas a sor Eng já não é tão revolucionária hoje como era né né aí pode ser vide videogames do se vier a sor se a sorce Vocês conseguem fazer uma nova sorce tem Impacto que teve a sorce antiga loucura Pô e o e o gab follower falou que tem dois Half lives em desenvolvimento um deles pode ser é um deles pode ser uma sequência do Half Life alix e outro deles Eles não sabem o que que é e mas assim só para deixar claro a sequência do Half Life alix pode se passar depois do episódio dois Porque no final do Half Life elex ele liga com o final do episódio 2 então é meio que um Half Life 3 só que o que aconteceu na real voltando um pouco Hum e o Half lifee 3 foi desenvolvido para valve e cancelado isso aconteceu e o o escritor do Half Life um e dois o leidl é um cara muito [ __ ] ele saiu da valve e Ele publicou no blog dele é agora ele já pagou mas tá na internet né Ele publicou uma história que Teoricamente a história do Half Life 3 se você ler nas entre linhas e você vê que ele só trocou os nomes do Gordon da da da Alex e você entende o que que rolou E aquela história é a história que seria Half Life 3 eu acho que quando ele fez isso a valve viu e falou [ __ ] Beleza agora a gente não pode mais fazer isso porque agora já tá vazada a história Então como que a gente faz aí o Half Life al entra e Altera a timeline ele ele tem uma viagem no tempo e tudo ele Altera a timeline ele altera o final do o episódio 2is então agora a sequência do Alex é um novo Half Life 3 entendeu e eu acho que eles estão sim desenvolvendo ess 3 e a mesma equipe que fez o Alex só que esse vai demorar e o que eu acho que eles estão fazendo agora é um protólito PC isso exatamente inclusive elix é muito bom é muito bom é muito bom mesmo bom é incrível Então tá aí é a notícia do Half Life da da semana e agora a gente tem uma aqui que o Fênix vai gostar Opa que é o problema que não é no Playstation não é no no na Steam ah nossa bom o Star Wars lançou né E aí Ubisoft ai esse seria mais um que os advogados iam cara mas é tão triste essa notícia É ISO Então vamos lá galera por favor ô ô Taques busca aí quanto é que custa a edição Gold ou a edição Ultimate do Star ahe então beleza então 550 Gold a Gold 650 Ultimate E aí você comprar é porque a Ubisoft ela vai lá né todas as as práticas que você pode ganhar um negocinho ali a OB soft tá fazendo e a nova que é não OB soft tá fazendo geral tá fazendo é aquele negócio paga mais cara aqui que você joga três dias antes ou na realidade é nós vamos fazer todo mundo jogar três dias depois e vamos deixar você paga mais cara para jogar antes é mais ou menos isso e E aí a galera que comprou essa edição no Playstation no mínimo Gold mas a Ultimate também é a mesma coisa você pode jogar três dias antes e aí a galera que comprou né a edição Ultimate ou a Gold tava jogando tal aí Ubisoft lançou um Patch porque de acordo com a Ubisoft o jogo que foi mandado para a galera antecipadamente né esses três dias antes estava quebrado e ia chegar algum momento do jogo que você não vai conseguir prosseguir e você precisa despatch para consertar isso até aí normal sim tudo bem só só que aí Ubisoft foi e falou o seguinte então aí você baixa o pet não dá para jogar sem o pet Então baixa o Pet Não Tem como jogar E aí eu não sei quanto tempo demorou né Depois des do você sabe desde do foi uns dois três dias tudo isso é acho que foi foi antes de lançar eu acho eu acho que foi dois dias é porque ó o lançamento do jogo é dia 30 hoje e isso aconteceu ontem is Então foi dois dias depois sim o viciado já jogou as 15 horas pelo menos aí tá pelo menos ele comprou antecipado quer jogar antes sim exatamente E aí o pessoal falou então aí você baixa esse Pet mas o que que vai acontecer esse Pet vai entrar e vai ter vai resetar seu se você vai ter começado zero mas eu não entendi uma dúvida a thí jogou no Xbox né o mikale Zerou no Playstation e ele não teve problema com isso então a versão dele era outra versão Acho que nem isso eu acho que é o seguinte acho que o pet corrige problemas e quando ele corrige problemas ele ele quebra alguma coisa no jogo aparentemente se você tá no espaço você não consegue pousar mais nenhum planeta tá tipo você consegue jogar ainda só que você não consegue progredir aham Então eu acho que a correção que eles fizeram no Playstation quebrou causou esse Crash na entendeu doira a gente não sabe é não não é talvez você esteja livre não Todo mundo se ferrou todo mundo todo mundo que doira cara bom mas o o PlayStation pelo menos roda o jogo bem né no PC tá triste a situação é no PC tá muito mal otimizado cara eu eu assisti a Live do Alan porque o PC é fora mas o Allan tem o melhor pessoa possível 4090 e tudo e engasgando toda hora o jogo na 4090 Caraca então assim é realmente tá mal otimizado o jogo no PC assim ao extremo eu joguei jogo inteiro 30 horas gostei muito do jogo mas a performance é uma coisa que pegou o jogo inteiro não teve um momento que eu falei nossa agora tá rodando bem não o jogo inteiro cara E aí de novo eu joguei no series S dito console mais fraco de agora eu não tive nenhum problema nenhum problema e isso que eu acho bizarro porque você falou que não teve bug né Nossa Senhora o que tive de bug nesse jogo e a galera tá dentro na internet Vira e Mexe a gente vê um vídeo no no finado ex agora que vai morrer eh o os vídeos de bugs da galera e muito bug muito bug bizarro não eu tive assim um ou dois bugs idiotas mas é do tipo duplicou uma hora o o nd5 uma hora ele tava falando comigo em pé e ele tava sentado no banco da nave ao mesmo tempo mas esse tipo de bug que você só dá risada acho tin algum bug da do nyx né que ele você tinha que apertar mais de uma vez o comando teve esse eu vi m gente falando não ele não fazia você tinha que apertar tipo umas duas três vezes el Mas eu tive bug é os bugs piores que eu tive por exemplo um que um som de alarme bugou e não parada de tocar E aí eu tive que reiniciar o jogo para parar é teve um ah esse bug do n eu tive que o NX não fazia a função que eu mandava eu tive reiniciar o jogo para ele começar a fazer as funções que mandava então vários bugzin assim no PC por exemplo Geralmente eu rodava 60 caindo para 30 às vezes é às vezes chegava em 100 100 mas às vezes ficava 30 para 20 para 10 aí eu tinha que reiniciar o jogo porque eu não sei o que acontecia ele ficava pior aí eu reiniciava e ele voltava a ficar um pouco melhor mas dis tudo isso eu me diverti muito no jogo o jogo é bom o jogo é bom aí aí eu digo mais porque eu dei uma rusada nele justamente porque a gente ia gravar vídeo tudo mas eu terminei esse jogo com umas 21 horas E aí eu fico pensando dois dias a pessoa já foi muito longe e aí qual que é a problemática para mim é muito triste porque com você volta né então não é porque quando você tá falando de videogame você tá falando de de um prazer ali de de um hobby e é uma experiência e cara a decepção que deve ser para você ver ali porque você recupera um monte de coisa você pode recuperar seu dinheiro você pode recuperar um monte de coisa mas o seu tempo você não recupera E aí o impacto que isso pode causar na pessoa quem que vai começar de novo pois é e isso vai minando a confiança que você tem na empresa também né gente não não não tudo bem também mas é assim cara é um jogo legal para quem é fã vai ver um monte de coisa legal também é um jogo que se você não conhece nada da franquia Star War você vai aproveitar o jogo do mesmo jeito porque ele pega uma narrativa que eu acho isso legal né que você não precisa conhecer nada do filme é claro que se se você for fã você vai pegar uns stegs para lá e para cá uns fun service F Serv é referências refer mas assim é triste porque a pessoa eu não voltaria se acontecesse isso comigo eu não ia jogar de novo por exemplo eu fechei o jogo com 21 horas se eu joguei 15 eu não ia fazer mais nada pois é e assim é uma decepção muito grande é que nem você que que perdeu o save do R exatamente como é que ess sensação porque eu tava jogando Val tava jogando em live a galera tá vendo eu tava com sei lá 80 horas eu tava curtindo PR Car vou Apesar cheio de bug também e E aí travou lá né Eu não e e assim é uma é uma cara porque assim no no meu caso foi diferente porque aqui o pessoal tá falando vai resetar irmão esquece Já era então você eu Passi por todas as fases do luto entendeu que eu tava ali aí aí e e era parada no tinha um mapa e você tinha que escolher o o a região lá que você ia PR pras próximas missões lá e aí tinha a região que não ia simplesmente não ia eu falei não bug não é possível aí reiniciava o videogame desligava não sei o que ia para cá ia para lá e nada e E nada e aí aí acabou e aí eu não conseguia mais jogar aí eu falei de tempos em tempos eu vou voltar aqui em live pra gente ver o que acontece aí no Natal saiu um pet aí eu falei um pet talvez aí eu entrei e assim que eu entrei e desencadeou uma ccin eu falei [ __ ] desbugou é isso só que não era era ccin do evento de Natal que teve lá tá ligado E aí eu fui lá na coisa aí só e e no meu caso ainda eh e e é justamente isso eu só terminei o Val porque eu tava fazendo Live eu não ia voltar eu também não voltaria jamais depois do que aconteceu só que aí passaram meses e eles lançaram outro Pet aí esse Pet cons consegi zerar sabe Ah então ainda teve o o momento da volta mas por exemplo mas quem que volta pro jogo para ver essa [ __ ] Cara é muito difícil você voltar depois de tanto tempo né Eu Eu Mesmo eu tenho muito isso para mim jogo sle Player principalmente é muito difícil voltar depois de um tempo porque eu já tive a experiência com aquele jogo eu já tô em outro jogo por que eu vou voltar para ele só se ele fori elden ring entendeu elden ring aí vai é um jogaço mas por exemplo Rogers Legacy eu nunca mais toque naquele jogo eu platinei ele nunca mais eu vou tocar nele e imagina se rolasse um negócio desse eu ia brochar de jogar e eu não ia jogar mais o jogo eu sinceramente se acontecesse isso que aconteceu com a galera de Playstation 5 comigo que só foi de Star Wars eu seria esse cara que compraria para jogar antes eu ia pedir reembolso do jogo de verdade e eu ia jogar no PC que é sempre melhor né então nem sempre jogar entendi eu acho que eu iria mas o PC pelo menos você não perde o o save entendeu tudo bem mas é isso Ó aí foi burriss minha eu assumo aqui mas eu tive uma coisa parecida com near em automata por quê joguei joguei joguei joguei joguei desci da nave não sei o quê fui lá fui vender as coisas pro primeiro Mercador vendi um monte de cor mão de cor repetido vou vender vendi vendi vend fiz um dos finais por vendi as minhas os meus cores principais faz ah você vendeu os CS principais você não é mais capaz de funcionar sozinha game over E aí quando eu voltei voltei lá de cima da nave ainda E aí eu olhei pro jogo eu falei então near não vou voltar para você agora e até agora não voltei pro jogo então assim por burriss mim agora imagina quando não se não fosse eu ia ficar com muita raiva e foi quanto tempo isso tipo uma hora menos não é porque primeiro tem toda a sequência Ah porque é um game over que ele dá um final né ele dá um final é verdade é verdade então assim eu voltei lá da eu nem tinha saído da nave a primeira vez ali do do espaço que era aquela nave que você saía correndo ela meio ovalada assim sim sim e simplesmente eu não voltei e isso foi burriss minha agora se fosse por culpa uma coisa que foge o meu controle cara eu fica muito revoltada eles deram uma recompensa né então é isso que eu ia falar agora porque acontece um negócio desse O que que a Ubisoft tá fazendo para recompensar o seu tempo e o seu dinheiro porque se você comprou para jogar antes e jogou antes se restar o seu save você né vai devolver teu dinheiro da versão sei lá o que aí que quanto é que vale esse negócio porque na versão timate né Vale alguma coisa isso né O que que a soft vai te D atenção na mensagem enviada a publisher informou que todos aqueles que tiveram recomeçar Aventura Star Wars perderam o seu tempo e o dinheiro e vão receber um item cosmético para o Trail Blazer a nave de kv junto com 100 créditos para usar no Ubisoft Connect quê é isso uma skin da nave e 100 crédit O Skin da nave que é um negócio que tem tipo 20 no jogo e todos eles são assim qualquer coisa entendeu não tem nenhum que nossa esse Skin [ __ ] que eu peguei da uma é qualquer coisa e eles dão um Skin sem ô galera aí que tá acostumado quanto é que é ação sem crédito no no no Ubisoft Connect acho que é pouca coisa porque é os negócios de cosmético lá não é você ganha fazendo missão jogando os jogos G paper e tal isso é isso aí é bem triste mesmo cara pô Eles podiam dar algum Far Cry 3 da vida um jogo pô é oito jogos desses mais antigos Escolhe um isso e esse é o negócio que a gente falou a mesma coisa do da Survivor cara que por que que acontece isso com o Star Wars né mas essas coisas estão na mão de de quem que estão na mão é mas essas coisas mancham o jogo que é bom né esse jogo assim com o Survivor é um jogo bom tá ele tem algumas missões repetitivas ele tem cara ele não tem tantos efeitos se você pensar os efeitos dele são reparáveis que é performance os bugs eles podem consertar isso O jogo vai ser bom no futuro que nem o J Survivor que no lançamento era um lixo e hoje in vai ter um novo pet para pc ainda caramba aa ainda P então o jedi é para mim o melhor jogo de Star Wars até hoje de todos os jogos e o out loss tirando todos esses problemas é o segundo para mim ele é melhor que eu falou Order cara eu gostei muito dele só que isso vai manchando o jogo e aí ele a primeira impressão é que fica né No final a galera vai lembrar desses momentos quando lembrar do jogo e isso é triste cara porque o jogo é bom mesmo pois é vocês T de cabeça se dá para pedir bolsa na PSN é então é pedir reembolso na PSN não não existe um botão de reembolso tem que estar com o saque do Playstation é muito complicado e normalmente não não não tem esse retorno era era caso realmente né porque se fosse comigo eu acho que pediria reembolso e assim se eu quisesse muito jogar eu compraria a versão normal Uhum recuperasse é 350 para 15 pelo menos R de volta comprei para jogar antes não joguei per exatamente n exatamente Caramba então mas você ia voltar pro jogo de qualquer maneira então se eu quisesse muito sabe tipo assim estilado Mas quero voltar Eu pediria o rebolso iria na versão Normal pô perdi os três dias de de de antecedência uma estratégia uma estratégia que a alb podia adotar de repente era algum tipo de crédito desconto para você pegar o Shadows sim podia ser várias coisas el pod porque aí não porque aí além disso a pessoa falou assim pô vou pegar o Assassin's Creed Shadows nem tava pensando mas eu vou pegar porque eu tô com um desconto bomito Mas se eu não quero o Shadow por exemplo eu eu não sou um cara que nossa quero jogar S se eles me dessem isso eu ia falar ah qualquer coisa op sabe umas oito nove opções assim desconto do próximo é Assassin's Creed valhala sei lá qualquer cois Cara infelizmente eu acho que a melhor opção é o reembolso não tem como de todas é o reembolso é o caminho que eles deviam tomar e é para aprender a não soltar o jogo antes do lançamento assim com a versão Deluxe cara você tá ferrando Quem pagou mais caroé é Ou você tem certeza que o jogo tá pronto naquela data ou você não faz essa estratégia cara porque eu achei que essa estratégia era tá bom o lançamento do jogo é quando dia 27 tá bom por serga o lançamento oficial para três dias e o lançamento de quem paga mais é o lançamento normal o jogo vai est pronto nesse dia mas esse jogo não tava pronto nesse dia isso Ficou claro por causa desse Pet aí então por que que eles fazem isso não pode fazer isso é errado po vamos ver eh ô Lourenzo Bianca mandou R 10 o PH Souza mandou 4$ o super dinossauro Crome mâncio virou membro por um ano o o Brian zera mandou 5 falou qual a configuração do PC do Fenix o meu PC é o Aurora R15 da R15 da alienware e ele tem uma 40 70 ti tem um I9 13ª geração eu acho que cof Lake 930 eu acho e é 32 GB de Ram eu não lembro direito mas é um PC muito bom ele roda tudo e só não rodou o Star Wars loss e ele só não rodou o hun Showdown update que teve fou muit ru a performance também e não e Inclusive eu parei de jogar o jogo porque o Run Showdown é um jogo muito preciso de Mira um tiro você morre e performance cair no meio da fight é é a pior coisa que o jogo e aí eu parei de jogar e eu tô esperando eles se consertarem mas tudo roda e é uma máquina muito boa que já veio montada e você não tem dor de cabeça de montar ela nem nada ela tem alguns benefícios de você não montar mas tem vários benefícios também eu gosto muito dela é aconselho ó o Felipe Fabrício de soua mand 5 falou estou aproveitando o gano do Live service estou jogando Warframe vendo Flow um dos Live service que tá tanto tempo no mercado sem pirata verdade o Warframe F conseguiu sobreviver né o did Kong mandou 5 falou notícia jogadores perdem sa do jogo da Ubisoft ramente dava flashback se per barala é a gente falou sobre isso aqui né o brero mandou uma falou que o Fênix é Devid do Half Life né eu eu eu é ué Nossa que sonho que seria imagina Nossa eu eu quero abrir uma petição para ele porv Não não precisa eu só quero trabalhar lá dentro eu não conto para ninguém nada que acontecea lá dentro J não não você ser um NPC dentro do jogo alum Você podia ser o insider do game follower Olha só eu poderia eu poderia ser o cara que passa as informações porque se você for te demit não pode né tem que tem que mandar bom gente GTA Tokio realmente chegou a começar a ser desenvolvido mas foi cancelado pela Rockstar imagina essa sem olha aqui aí eu ia jogar GTA pô mas aí porque assim é que a galera não lembra muita gente não lembra mesmo mas já teve GTA fora do Estados Unidos do dos Estados Unidos teve o China eh teve o o London exato foi esse foi foi antes do dois ou foi depois do dois não sei se foi entre um e o dois entre dois e o trê aluma coisa assim mas o China Awards é nos Estados Unidos não é é o e a ma é porque a rockstar é de lá né é de Londres então eles fizeram o jogo em em Londres Mas normalmente é tudo nos Estados Unidos é a empresa de Londres mais Americanas de todas né a rockstar é exato conhecem muito bem M muito bem os American tá aqui ó segundo o time extension ex desenvol da cock Star Eita [ __ ] pega a nuvem de volta aí nuv a nuvem caiu aqui o contou que o sun hauser presidente da empresa havia visitado Tókio algumas vezes e ficou apaixonado pela cidade essa paixão teria motivado San ruser a criar o GTA Tókio que até chegou a começar a ser desenvolvido mas foi cancelado o jogo teria entrado em fase de desenvolvimento antes do San Andreas e depois do GTA 3 entre 2 e 2004 ou seja eles fizeram o vice city né no meio do caminho aí e para começar a desenvolver o jogo a rockstar enviou uma equipe à cidade com a finalidade de colher informações e mapeá-lo Entretanto a dificuldade em criar uma narrativa com sua sátira característica foi considerado um desafio elevado para a equipe que culminou no cancelamento do jogo is exatamente isso que eu ia falar como é que você ia causar desse jeito no Japão Pois é é por quê Por quê Porque o Japão é muito certinho muito mas essa é graça Então mas dá para fazer Fênix mas assim eh o jeito que o o GTA faz a sátira dos Estados Unidos é de uma do conhecimento Tão Profundo do que acontece lá de nos mínimos detalhes é muito detalhe e eu entendo ele falo não ia conseguir fazer isso não é não é que não dá para fazer dá para fazer eles acharam que eles não iam conseguir fazer Sim e se a rock star Matic não consegue fazer alguma coisa é porque deve ser difícil para [ __ ] meso lembrando 2001 a 2004 né Tipo o internet nem era tão assim exato informação cultura de lá hoje em dia né enfim não fora que assim né É É uma sociedade delicada japonesa a gente não sabe até que ponto dava para fazer as coisas sem ofender de repente não mas o hoje at ofende todo mundo então mas aí eu não sei como que como que seriao deles é ofender né Não então mas como que seria isso essa recepção por parte do japonês porque de repente eles iam fazer aquela fuga da polícia e de repente fal Ah vocês estão falando que a nossa polícia é idiota ah vai ia ter tudo isso aí mas eu acho que também é questão aconteceu Taí se acontec isso porque eu acho que a a rockstar tá [ __ ] se o Japão não gostar do jogo deles entendeu o público deles não é eu eu acho que vai eu acho que é outra coisa eu acho que é assim tipo eles poderiam fazer isso aí só que no Japão as coisas que acontecem no GTA Ficaria um troço extremamente cartunesco e bizarro tá entendendo Então mas para isso a gente tem acusar por exemplo e acusar trata de uma maneira que inclusive eles fazem consultoria com com os membros da e acusar não é isso S não mas é mas a acusar é totalmente galhofa né o o GTA é um meio termo ali muito complexo que eles acertam né e o morao né A Crítica Certeira ali da sociedade o yakuza eles vão pr pra loucura e aí é obviamente é um troço extremamente exagerado e tal mas é muito exagerado né e é o humor muito japonês né aquilo hum é muito humor japonês mesmo que é bem diferente do que a gente tá conhecendo aqui então assim eu eu adoraria a gente ter o GTA do japon ser um negócio incrível Será que impu de alguma forma vi sir não sei possível cheio de neon tal Será que tem alguma infuência na escolha do Siri já que a gente não consegue Tokio O que que a gente consegue fazer algo meio parecido aqui bom ponto pois Mas enfim ele não falou né um jogo parecido com o GTA que é no Oriente é sliping dog mas é não é no Japão né em Hong Kong ele se passa é muito legal ele é muito legal ele é muito legal muito bem feito também outro que é Square F né porque a Square acabou com b ó Vitor peão mandou C falou que não acho que já deu essa deudo ser Mundo Aberto 100 horas de Gameplay indú tá confundindo quantidade e qualidade ah Vitor tô contigo aí tá porque também Nossa senhora cara fala aí próximo Assassin's Creed ou jogar al wake 2 de novo sem saber nada al wake 2 de novo sem saber nada pelo amor de Deus né cara e e é então assim eu eu que que é do Allan wake desculpa eu perdi não jogar o novo Assassin's Creed né 1 horas 100 horas ou jogar o al wake é dois de novo sem sem a memória perde a memória jog M jog vai 18 horinha ali ó eu iria Fá noake eu gosto de jogo fechadinho não Eu também adoro tá fazendo falta hoje em dia todo mundo aberto concordo com ele o Gabriel R mandou 10 falou muito obrigado Flow games peguei a chave do do cong no discord peguei para melhor plataforma de todos obviamente a Steam Claro depois da Live a [ __ ] vai comer Car muito legal cara e é legal que esse jogo tá muito bom no PC coisa que é raridade né é o contrário do do Star Wars out Lost ele roda muito bem no PC ele roda mal no Play 5 mas pesado hein é Nossa Senhora é mas é o gráfico dele é bem bem forte né grfico dele é melhor que o out loss e ele roda melhor que o out loss isso que é bizarro é mas é né fal assim eu eu quando Continuo jogando o kg e eu só o bagulho só me impressiona mais Man porque quando você vai evol pegando armaduras novas cara as armaduras vão ficando cada vez maiores mais boladas Mas é uma quantidade de detalhe nas armad que eu não gosto absurdo pô é bagulho absurdo é muito detalhe é muito grande muita coisa E aí vai tipo subindo aqui na ombreira vai subindo uma ombreira tá ligado Vai cheio de coisa e aí eu peguei uma arma que é a arma lá das Aranha que a minha a arma tem uma animação diferente das outras armas tipo ass a ponta da da arma tem tem aqui a ponta dela sim e tem várias patinhas de aranha e ela fic se mexendo o tempo todo então tipo assim a a a arma tem uma animação o tempo todo da das patas se mexendo é uma coisa de louca cara os detalhes assim é impressionante as animações joga negócio muito impressionante teve essa semana uns vídeos de que eles treinaram os gatinhos para pegar coletar informação de como os os quadrúpedes se moviam você viu isso aí eles ficaram dois TR anos coletando dado para ver como que eles fariam as animações dos chefes quadrúpedes que aquele tigre do deserto lá achei M da hora não o cara é doido tem uma luta que a gente faz com javali depois que é um javali mesmo grande quatro P tal que é absurdo pô realmente as animações é bizarro a hora que o bicho cai que ele levanta é cara as animações do jogo São surreais mesmo já Ó o Daniel de Souza Santana Acabou de virar membro Muito obrigado eh o o Gabriel já falei o Gabriel Felipe mandou outro Gabriel na verdade mandou R 5 falou alguma dica para matar com mais facilidade os inimigos da cidade dourada em Alden ring um abraço a todos cara vai Farma e faz uma be aí melhor porque cidade Dourada é a capital que tá qu eu acho que Cap Ach pensando na DC eu acho que eles T dano sagrado né então tenta fazer uma build que tem resistência de dano sagr tem os amuletos lá eu

esqueci desculpa gente ou faz o padrão faz build bleeding não mas isso é básico por você não está usando Build de Bling só consegui matar o diabo do do último bossing botei a Build de Bleach porque bagulho é absurdo eu fiz algo parecido o garoto degustador de secis mandou na verdade esse aqui é o de remakes é mandou dej falou salve galera Tô terminando Persona 5 já pensando em comprar um metafor na pré-venda ou o próprio Persona 3 qual seria o melhor pô pergunta difícil essa não saiu metafor ainda mas tem preview no site do FL G no site do flog game com com dúvida e quiser saber um pouquinho mais do jogo tem lá quem que jogou o Tom Tom viajou PR PR Nova York Nova York isso mesmo pô que beleza hein pô caramba onde vai para wash vai para Nova York viu eu tô aqui e bom eu tô aqui é Eh vamos lá calma aí aqui pô mas o o cross que foi para Washington teve um perrengue chique agora na volta vocês viram 11 horas de atraso o voo deles eles ficaram eles ficaram no aeroporto não sei eu acho que é de em Washington mesmo eles ficaram no aeroporto de Washington 11 horas esperando o voo E aí atrasou né para a chegada deles no Brasil coitados Eles estão no avião agora eu acho ainda não eu falei Atlanta porque da Summer a volta da s todo mundo teve problema no aeroporto de Atlanta o meu vo inclusive atrasou tipo umas 7 horas e cancelaram a gente perdeu o taque lá também não foi Ah vocês perderam o taqueo lá verdade a gente perdeu taqueo verdade eu gostei foi falado que parece que não encontraram ainda não achamos a gente perdeu mas encontrou não demorou umas duas horas mas a gente encontrou tá queix você está sem seus bem que tinha o outro voo era tipo assim 5 horas depois porque senão a gente tá ponto aqui Ach que passear Atlanta pô ele foi pra cidade C cidade fo foi curtir a cidade o Cassiano virou mesmo pelo 26º mês falou Cadê o PlayStation 5 pro já já que tem comprar out na espera do pro pô Eu particularmente e a gente vai falar sobre Playstation 5 pro eu não aguento mais essas notícias de Playstation 5 pro cara olha só a gente chegou no ponto tá que a digital olha olha olha o ponto que a gente chegou que a dig foundry que é que Analisa hardware e não só eles tá mas tô dizendo que eles são fez a análise do trailer do GTA V e falou que não roda no Play 5 que não foi nem pro que nem foi anunciado a gente chegou nesse nível de falar sobre o P5 pro o PS5 pro ele vai ser lançado junto com Silk song isso e o o novo Suit vem todo mundo junto pelo menos novo Suit foi anunciado né É É verdade porque o pro an falou falam que vai rolar vai rolar o P5 pro ninguém falou nada do pro não sabe nada desse negócio ramento que é mais fato até hoje assim né do ano sim só que essa semana essa semana eh saíram várias informações de várias pessoas diferentes foi do jeito que a gente conhece como a informação andando nessa indústria parece parece legítimo Ok não poderemos mostrar as imagens aqui porque eu sei lá vazamento eu acho né não é muito interessante e do protótipo que é você pode mostrar pra gente Ô taqueo e e bota no chat pra galera Entrar no portal isso bota no chat tá no portal vog games.gg tem uma suposta imagem baseado no que o b BK lá que é um dos insiders que falou que viu ele falou que viu a caixa e falou que viu o PlayStation 5 pro tá tratem obviamente como rumor isso aqui mas é que a gente tá falando vamos lá segundo informações do bkom teria visto parte da frente da caixa do Play 5 pro o console terá um visual bem similar ao que foi visto no Slim por questões de copyright direitos autorais ele não chegou a divulgar a foto do que viu mas fez essa ilustração baseada na foto que viu galera do chat aí entra no link gente que aí vocês podem aí tá tá aí no no no chat vocês podem olhar também com a gente tá então assim olhando bonitinho ele é igualzinho o o slin só que esse meio dele tem uns é Então em vez de um risco ele tem três da didas né É porque o o slin já tem uma divisória né no no meio e aí esse você tem duas a mais é isso pois é de repente é o Face Play de que você vai trocar em cima e embaixo é o dus lin assim eu troco em cima em baixo mas assim ó eh ele tem leitor de disco não tem esse aí não tem aí é uma questão porque o que acontece outra coisa também é que na frente tem dois duas entradas SBC vamos lá galera vamos superar é o SBC é o SBC agora o SBA quantos anos foi o SBA hein foi muito tempo [ __ ] uns 10 anos aí bons usbc tá então dis que existe PC era o SBA né já pô quando a gente tinha MP3 lá começo anos 2000 já era o SBA Pois é e antes disso de é então né é esse é E aí alguns detalhes sobre né a o hard vamos lá na imagem que vocês viram aí é possível notar que o videogame na parte frontal vem apenas com duas portas usbc e o botão poder Tá mas nesse que ele viu não tem leitor de disco o bbuk disse ainda não ter certeza se o play 5 pro terá um leitor de discos Mas o que o item realmente estava ausente no que ele teve acesso apesar da Incerteza em relação ao assunto ele acredita aqui assim como na versão Slim os jogadores poderão conectar um acessório para isso né que já tá vendendo inclusive não apenas isso ele acredita que a Sony pode lançar um console sem um leitor de disco justamente para oferecer um preço mais competitivo tá E aí o que eles falaram também é que o PlayStation 5 pro deve ter 2 ta de SSD o que né tem que ter mesmo não cabe nada nesse nesse negócio nenum ter que não é nenhum Tera é 600 e poucos gig quer dizer o sling agora é né o slin já é é o que eu tenho não é eu acho que agora o slin é 600 e pouco é mas não fica 820 20 no final porque instala o o o os né É sim ele não é então acaba diminuindo exatamente mas é que do Play 5 normal é era um número bizarro tipo 825 G co 800 e pouco total aí ele tinha 600 e pouquinho ah tá entendi ó Outro fator interessante notar pel console Premium utiliza o mesmo conector de energia do modelo base ou seja terá o mesmo uso de energia e o que isso tem a ver basicamente sem energia Extra mas sistemas de arrefecimento aprimorados o videogame deve ser mais silencioso e apresentar temperaturas menores O que é bom obviamente vai ser um upgrade e a é E aí eu acho assim ah e e os rumores apontam eu não aguento mais que na primeira quinzena de Setembro teremos um evento do sasson para mostrar isso aí e se tiver a gente vai estar aqui para ver com vocês tá acho você acha que agora vai Porque quem falou foi o Jeff grubby não foi que já é uma fund de confiança BO e o PS4 pro foi anunciado em setembro e lançou em novembro aí ó eu sempre acredito nesses rumores porque eu sempre acho que tem um dedinho de alguém lá de dentro Solta esse vazamento para poder ver um termômetro de como que tá nesse caso aí vazou tantas vezes eles falaram tantas vezes que ia sair não sei o que e nunca saiu nada né esse porque às vezes o termômetro não tava bom ah aí eles esperaram até tá bom é não sei não sei também é Pois é eh então né fica nessa aí vamos ver se vai sair eu cansei eu cansei playi msei muito Play 5 bro eu cansei assim o Xbox então isso isso isso é uma boa é o seguinte eu acho eu eu a gente vai acabar comprando porque o nosso trabalho aqui então Claro mas eh se eu fosse a pessoa normal que não trabalhasse com isso se eu tivesse PlayStation não não ia não não eu eu assim hoje fica difícil entender Qual é a lógica desse negócio porque vai ter o cssd a mesma coisa cara para ter aí porque se você me garantir que esse Playstation 5 vai rodar tudo 60 frames não vai garantir né não vai garantir tem tem uns humores aí de novo como oficial Oi The Last of Us 3 aí aí faz sentido o play 5 pro entendeu de que eles iam usar o pssr era isso o nome FS Sr não não fsr do Playstation entendi eles criaram um deles eles criaram um deles um scaler né isso e que eles talvez fossem utilizar geração de frames em alguns jogos também da tecnologia deles é E aí eu acho que dá para mas hoje o play 5 não tem geração de frame com f tem o con inclusive USA é é só que tá caind hein é o Xbox acho que usa no qual que era o jogo Aquele da ia que era meio indie meio FPS é a fugiu o nome de quem da i India FPS ah eu tô ligado real 5 Você sabe qual que é que flopou aí immortals of avion isso Imortal of Av esse ele usa FR também então tem alguns jogos que tem mas eu não sei porque que não Todos usam é mas ia ser um proprietário da Sonic coisa aleatória na hora que o Vini falou cong roda f o Kong é u Kong Kong Kong Kong não roda no lugar nenhum esse jogo Kong não roda É É Então eu acho que tudo vai depender realmente da estratégia de preço da Sony Eu acho que o correto e é o que se eu não me engano aconteceu com o PlayStation 4 pro que quando ele veio ele veio no preço acho que foi 00 não foi E aí ele e aí o preço do base desceu uma coisa assim né se o preço do do pro for o preço do Playstation base e o PlayStation base que no caso agora é julin reduzir pô é ótimo sabe aí aí tudo bem Eu duvido demais até aumentaram o PRP agora 9 Play aumentou o preço do Japão é um aumento muito bizarro néro S aqui né aquele aumento do SS aqui era S masos cara tá na na casa deles Man 0 é me esquisito né vendendo bem lá então não assim tá mas não tá como deveria sabe no mercado de lá porque lá é muito forte PlayStation e não faz menor ainda vende mais Switch lá do que Playstation que bizarro né agora não mas o Switch tá insano né Switch é insano né cara vem 50 milhões de Pokémon bizarro Car bizarro é só com Pokémon ruim imagina se fos bom se fosse bom era mais ainda moleque Nossa Senhora que louco é então vamos ver aí você Setembro agora né noss Setembro vai vai acontecer tudo em setembro tudo vai realmente né É mas me diram uma dúvida Setembro chove chove chove éch porque o crosson tá aqui e tá o Vini então o neg tá muito sério o programa precis começa Primavera começa a ch mais PR al ó o Tiago baixo R 5 DVE me fez voltar a colecionar cartinhas tô no 51 boa e achei minha coleção de criança com vários brilhantes da edição um Charizard de Blastoise irmão vai avaliar isso vende ganha grana aí tá mas é importante que essas cartas estejam no bom estado que senão Vale pouco mesmo Charizard se não tiver num estado bom vale Vale bem pouquinho ou então guarda irmão porque isso aí é relíquia eu tô tentando completar o bz7 eu tô esse fim de semana a gente foi eu comprei tinha um cara lá com várias cartinhas tá falando sempre eu tô colecionando eu tô completando gente é gente é ué e aí eu comprei as cartas do base set impecáveis cara impecáveis e o Hugo lag do R falou só sua família não consigo sair do COD multiplayer e warzone queria muito jogar Red Dead 2 e o o Zelda tiktok porque sei que vou gostar mas só de pensar o com grande a conta demora para fechar já desisto acontece isso com vocês cara é tem un jogos de desanimo assim pô pô tem principalment Principalmente quando tem você tem vários jogos para escolher aqui ó é sabia que esse é um dos os motivos que eu não jogo Persona por exemplo Porque eu sei que é um jogo muito longo e eu tenho muito jogo para jogar eu quero jogar o Persona mas pô sem 50 horas não e assim amo Persona mas eu eu sei que para quem tá de fora e vê ah é um J RPG RPG de turno O pessoal já olha F Hum então isso já afasta um pouco mas eu te garanto que uma vez que você tá imerso ali Você nem sente passar eu eu eu imagino Eu imagino mas aí o dia de lock quando que eu vou jogar enquanto eu jog aí é difícil aí para jogar dois fora do que a gente trabalha tá sempre chegando algum jogo é esse que a loucura e Essa época então é de maluco Pô eu não encostei no H Kong até agora porque eu tava no outl é e eu não joguei o outl porque eu tô no H Kong tem é eu também não joguei o Kong e tem um jogo que vocês não estão repando Talvez o vin tá que vai lançar agora em setembro dia 7 eu acho que é o Space Marines 2 não eu eu tô ripando pô meio Gears of War meio é multiplayer Coop [ __ ] eu gostei muito me lembro divers na real porque é um monte bicho vindo para cima de vocês vocês T que matar eles eu tô curtindo muito que que eu vi esse jogo é também bom galera vamos então para o reaction games Opa vamos embora Ah só uma coisa antes que o Male me deixou encarregado de falar aqui calma a calma a calma que foi na ele me deixou encarregado de falar ele mandou áudio não ó lembrar aqui seguinte essa semana saiu texos do Jeff que ele viajou PR Los Angeles S Francisco para testar Street Fighter 6 tem dois texos dele lá falando de novidades do Street Fighter 6 que é o v Rivals acho que é isso você treina com com nível acima do seu do seu elo e ele também soltou um texto sobre o Terry bogard e Monster Hunter Wild ele já testou E tem também do Thomas que a gente comentou agora H pouco que jogou o metap maravilhoso falou com o pessoal lá ai você sabe se ele falou com chor sedima não se é o ilustrador eu sei que tem vídeo Nossa gente olha aqui que oportunidade maravilhosa que ele invejei aqui tá invejei mera fora eu joguei um pouquinho lá na games latan tá Fantástico eles disponibilizaram três builds diferentes para você jogar ah de três momentos diferentes três momentos diferentes um mais no início um mais ali no meio uma luta com Boss Nossa gente que que coisa maravilhosa então ó conteúdo de idade que tá

Fenix mas não simultâneo não não não simultâneo porque que acontece quando você chega no máximo você ganha um item aí você pode compra o item vai PR próxima e [ __ ] entendeu Aí eu fiz isso mas não dá cara eu acho que é muito difícil você ter todas bem sabe uma delas vai ficar mal mas eu não tô ouvindo o retorno aqui ainda só só eu não eu t ah não não é s tava vamos lá o Thomas que foi foi jogar o metafor né vamos ver o que que o Thomas falou vai fala aí meus amigos do Flow games estamos aqui num espaço incrível que a Sega preparou pra gente olha só que legal aqui onde veio testar o metaphor eles reservaram a sinagoga Angel Suns foundation em Nova York um espaço que tem tudo a ver com a atmosfera e temática do jogo eu sei que a nossa querida tamatsu já testou o jogo e também curtiu e que o dava gosta muito de Persona também então é maneiro que é o mesmo time dos Persona né só que agora est apostando uma pegada mais de fantasia que para mim pelo menos encaixou bem pra caramba a Sega botou a gente para testar as primeiras horas do jogo e liberaram aqui essas imagens exclusivas também que vocês estão vendo aí Hum eu joguei o começo da campanha e depois um trecho mais adiantado um 10 horinhas depois ali eu gostei que tipo por mais que eu goste de Persona normalmente o começo desses RPG é bem lento né demora um pouco para pegar só que dessa vez não ele já começa mais agitado até nos tutoriais ele tá mais rápido também porque Apesar dele ter combate por turno ele é misturado com ação em tempo real então ficou bem interessante essa mistura dos dois tipos de luta funciona bem eu senti um pouco até o ritmo dos Final Fantasy mais novos né e no trecho mais adiantado que a gente jogou eles meteram sistemas mais de mundo aberto Tinha muita opção de coisa para fazer deixou o jogo muito profundo mesmo tem lá os social links lá de sempre só que um monte de atividade paralela também para fazer então eu gostei para caramba para quem curte o gênero eu acho que deve ser aí um dos candidatos a gote até e eu quero saber de vocês aí da bancada que que vocês estão achando do metafor aqui ó antes de eu partir aqui eu falei com o pessoal da atlos Eles mandaram um recado especial direto n ai que legal gente que que legal que legal esse salve foi legal ai não assim incrível gente ó o jogo que eu mais estô esperando agora ele lança em outubro 2 de outubro não 12 de outubro outubro é perto da BGS Então acho que é 4 de ou 8 de outubro eu não sei eu tava ali no comecinho de Outubro na minha cabeça mas gente de novo joguei um pouquinho lá na gamescom o jogo tá Fantástico as animações são maravilhosas toda essa dinâmica que tem mesmo na na parte de batalha de turno e tudo mexe arte é super espirrando tudo na tua cara ai gente é muito lro 10 de outubro o Thomas ele é um Pokémon do tipo micali né É É né Muito Como assim um Pokémon do tipo micali que não é desse planeta assim sabe você vê que tem tem traços mical tros mesc né um abraço pro Thomas aí ele sabe thas valeu Thomas você você pode por favor começar a falar mestre e se referir a todo mundo como mestre por favor eu acho que falta isso nele né Para eu não sei se ele é do mesmo planeta do mikali mas deve ser da vizinhança ali da mes mesmo sistema sol MM sistema né é tipo diglet e wiglit sabe entendi entendeu que mais temos aí gente que legal ah esse é bom esse é bom eo é uma das fases de Star Wars outl ai é é é o nível do dos npcs da Inteligência artif nível da Inteligência Ah mas aí né Mostra aí Mostra aí vamos ver acho que isso aí tá verídico é porque os são meio idiotas mesmo aí ó ninguém acerta ninguém olha o cara ô esse carinha aí cara é uma confusão sabe ó cara Car Ele tá em cima do que que é isso e ele não tá isso acontece muito cara bug com speeder bug com speeder é o negócio que eu mais vi nesse jogo acontecer cara então eu falei que eu não tive bug nenhum Fênix Mas será que é porque eu não fui atrás das Missões paralelas Ah não sempre pior nos bagulhos Paralelos sempre pior Miss principal é mais mais então como eui agora cortou o meu áudio eu jur tirou o cabo a cabo Esse é o difícil de ficar nesse lugar do Cross que tá isso mas eu juro que eu nem me mexi Cross o cross sofre acha que é fácil para ele é horrível esse lar tá conectado no USB e depois conecta aqui aí ó tá ligado eu juro que eu nem tinha me mexido não tá funcionando tenta desbloquear e blogar ti b a foi foi foi bom V nem respirar aqui é é difícil essa posão mesmo is essa mão é do Cross não é do Cross é o cross é o cross da massa Ah vamos lá o cross lá em Washington no evento do COD next waston Washington foi muito bom foi é assim o evento em sim a Live que ele fez e tentou fazer lá não foi tão boa né deua todo mundo o funk o Rash todo mundo que fez Live teve problema net tava ruim depois a luz caiu Nossa a luz caiu a luz do lugar duas vezes caiu a luz do lugar duas vezes aí caiu todas as lives eu acho que foi o o cod next com o mais problema de todos que eles fazem porque eles sempre fazem é sempre muito [ __ ] rar raramente tem tem esses problemas pô ele fez um Story mostrando a galera com os PCs streamando eraa muita gente lugar mu gente cara e era todos os PCs [ __ ] assim 40 90 e essa cadeira todos cartin essa cadeira tipo assim 60 dessas cadeir mas aí Provavelmente o que aconteceu foi justamente isso não a eles não devem ter previsto o quanto que é puxar de energia pô pode ser porque essas placa aí puxa muito eram dois PCs não era era um pc que eles jogava e um PC streaming o PC para streaming né doideira hein lá lá vamos lá ver o cross aí em Washington polêmico Fala aí galera do Flow games ó pra nossa briga sobre quem venceria a respeito Ah não do Galo contra o pombo não é possível eu só tenho uma coisa para falar PR vocês fala então eu nunca vi um galo espião na minha vida nca ah já o pombo desde 1914 cara é uma câmera espião tá bom respeito ao pombo todos vocês aí da mesa do chat assunto encerrado o pombo é [ __ ] Olha a cara dele tá bravo esse pombo agora mostra uma galinha espinha aí quero ver esse é o desafio é isso valeu é assim negócio o negócio não era Quem Quem tinha mais e é a Time como fala quem quem conquistou é quem quem ia deitar o outro na porrada eu vou mandar um trugo pr ele tá tem pombo espião não tem galo espião Mas ele já viu pombo de calça Eu já vi galo de calça verdade tem o galo de calça realmente o galo famosíssimo G galo tá de calça É porque o pombo não é otário deixarem botar calça nele fo o pombo é bravo espião meu espião atenção o Espião todo mundo qualquer espião aí tá o Espião ele é uma máquina de matar pô ele não é só um espião entendeu então o pombo que é espião Ele é super Pombo mas ó Mas quem briga é galo Então quem briga é Gal não não tinha um canal que fazia umas suposições assim tipo quem ganharia Goku versus Superman não sei o qu tem que fazer alguém tem que alguém tem que sugerir el fazer o Galo contra o pombo usa calça porque ele Caga toda hora né E aí ele ia cagar as calças calça também toda avve caga sem parar entendi a tem um canal que faz cheer list da natureza que eu falei eu falei o tierz isso isso tiar zo é muito bom e isso aí é o que ô Takes Splinter Cell Ah isso aí é o seguinte ah cyberpunk Ultra realista você mand aquele modou tal entrou a versão 2.0 agora doideira aquela era 1.0 Dream punk 2.0 Graphics em 8k Man exatamente e que que ela traz agora tem nuvem volumétrica que tem tem uns esquemas de cor da nuvem que reflete no mundo do jogo e essas nuvens têm sombras no mundo sombras Caramba aí eles colocaram mais coisas de de HDR e mais algumas outras coisas que eu não vou lembrar de cabeça esse cara lá não é do Sprint Cell é da militech militech do do caraca sim não esse gráfico falei enchend o saco por causa do óculos parecia mesmo pô eu acho muito [ __ ] o estilo visual das coisas no surdo imagem real não tanto é que você foi falando falar beleza porque para mim era imagem tipo de um map uma pessoa fazendo alguma captura aí absurdo é é querendo ou não a r criou um jogo aí mas é [ __ ] fazer ser humano ainda é o bagulho mais difícil que é impressionante as coisas ficam perfeitas mas ser Human você queo é não assim na sombra me convence esses jogos qu mais l e melhora a iluminação Max Max T eu f erado Caraca a as animações são muito bonitas também deve ter algum Mod para melhorar isso aí porque não era tudo isso não nossa sinistro hein Muito [ __ ] mas assim para rodar Nossa essa Ferrari aí que o cara botou no jogo é para rodar isso aí o PC que tem que ser como é tem que ser duas 40 90 ligadas em sli lembra disso SL hoje em dia não tem mais ninguém faz isso como que era o nome chess Elite um outro nome Crossfire MD né MD é que botar os dois juntos Pô isso aí aparece o osirus do GTA lembro do osirus é histórico carro histórico repara que ele sempre deixa o tempo nublado quanto esse tempo nublado com iluminação boa convence demais que é real ah hum é uma técnica entendi Caraca que Sinistro hein Olha que [ __ ] e assim night City é uma cidade muito linda muito muito muito lindo então ainda mais passando rápido assim para mim saí filmaram num num go na cabeça do cara eu tenho muita dúvida como que vai ser o cyberpunk 2 né se eles vão sair de night City né porque night City é tão icônico pro cyberpunk que seria estranho até eles saírem da cidade Ah mas aí não não vale o mesmo para GTA por exemplo as cidades são icônicas são mas o GTA ele fez isso desde sempre né tipo assim teve muito GTA antes de estourar mesmo que é em vários lugares tipo San Anders e V City saíram muito perto ali não deu para marcar assim e GTA é San andre é porque

que seja boa boa tarde boa noite pessoal do FL games todo mundo da mesa pessoal da redação e todos os envolvidos primeiramente Como tá o final de semana de vocês o meu ó já tá esperando ali óin tal já está me aguardando desde o primeiro que eu joguei que foi me interessei muito pela empresa fiquei até pensando quem sabe um dia trabalhar nela tá ligado na ubsoft cara a ubsoft é um estúdio talentoso muito promissor e eu espero sinceramente que um dia sua reputação volte para era de ouro sobre Star Wars eu assinei o bisoft Plus Premium por um mês para poder experimentar essa maravilha antes do lançamento cara eu tô com em torno de umas 8 horas mais ou menos e tô jogando via Xbox series x né e Cara infelizmente eu não consegui fazer a portabilidade pro PC porque ainda tá com problema né novidades Eu seria muito hipócrita em dizer isso mas se algum jogador casual tiver interess em comprar o game cara dá uma esperada espera o jogo dar aquela baixada de valor tá ligado PR fã doente que nem eu que foi até a comprar a versão de PS5 do steelbook cara nem perde seu tempo tá ligado compra que a força esteja com vocês você é tá bom passa aí ok momentos assim cara que é esado sabe porque o Star Wars é assim na real tem vários momentos que nos filmes Você vem umas piadinhas assim e o jogo faz isso muito bem leg vou assinar o soft Plus igual ele depois e jogar assim bo é uma boa né porque você ganha a edição Deluxe lá e [ __ ] ISO vai lá que mais Ah só um detalhe sobre a edição Deluxe a gente não comentou ela vem com a missão do jaa né só nela ah é verdade e é uma pena porque essa missão é tão boa boa eu não consigo não aconselhar as pessoas a jogarem essa missão mas é tem que pagar a Deluxe eu acho muito ruim quando você exclusiva missão cara é aí Temporada é uma coisa missão é outra né é e é uma missão tão boa do diaba mas tá começando a virar padrão né algumas missões serem limitadas ao tipo de console Ou de repente o tipo de versão do jogo que lança é infelizmente Tomara que não Peg próximo aí vai lá T ah próximo aqui é o Hugo pontual Parece que tem uma recomendação aqui hein Hugo pontual Olha o fantasma fantasma aí ó estão conhecendo zero Esse Fantasma aqui é

também aqui ring que eu peguei na Live de vocês olha e parab jog porque eu tô deixando o vício do Destiny e entre outro Cassino outro cça nquel que é justamente o ging tô jogando g e como recomendação de joguinho pro switch e para outras plataformas Boomerang full joguinho muito divertido para jogar em Pari é discordia na certa eend quatro jogos a mesmo tempo cara um ninja é que a recomendação dele deixa tudo aberto para mostrar ali que ele tinha ele tem o monitor Ultra Wide que o mal do monitor Ultra Wide cara alguns jogos não rodam ele aí fica com essas bordas pretas do lado eu eu acho muito ruim PR vamos lá próximo aqui é o Edson mandou o vídeo ele descobriu alguém que mandou uma jogada bem estilosa aqui no Black ma Black vamos ver fluid game a música é muito tikt isso né Caraca erada irada cara mas esse kage buun é muito bom é muito maneiro e dependendo do inimigo você derrete o inimigo é bizarro porque assim a Chin Não claro que não a única coisa ruim desse negócio é que ele demora para você soltar e e os bichos spawnam aí tem um delay até ele ir para cima do cara aham e esse delay Se você usar um tempo errado dá ruim então assim e se você não pode fazer nada se você esquivar ele cancela Então você tem que usar então o que você faz você paralisa o inimigo e chama os cara se você conseguir fazer no tempo certo você vai derreter os caras porque todo mundo vai bater junto e o e o e o inimigo não vai não vai conseguir reagir vai ficar tando porrada porrada porrada porrada e tal e dar muito dano até eles sumirem é igual chamar o mímico né no ring não esse é mais eu
